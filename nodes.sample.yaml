  #   networkInterfaces:{}# (REQUIRED) Network interface configuration (as defined at http://talos.dev/v1.11/advanced/advanced-networking/), this allows multiple interfaces with advanced options.
  # ...
######
# Example networkInterfaces configuration:
# This confiuration has 2 interfaces, one that is used for management and one for storage traffic.
# The management interface has a VIP for high availability.
# The storage interface has jumbo frames enabled.
# Both interfaces have static IPs and are selected based on their MAC address.
# Adjust as necessary for your environment.
